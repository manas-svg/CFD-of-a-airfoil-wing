This project provided me with both theoretical and practical insights at the intersection of aerodynamics, computational simulation, and machine learning. My key learnings are outlined below:

üõ©Ô∏è Aerodynamics & Design Principles
Developed a deeper understanding of airfoil and wing design parameters, such as aspect ratio, sweep, taper, and camber, and their influence on aerodynamic performance.

Studied in detail the behavior and significance of aerodynamic coefficients:

Lift coefficient (Cl): Relationship between wing shape and generated lift

Drag coefficient (Cd): Factors affecting parasitic and induced drag

Moment coefficient (Cm): Its impact on pitch stability and control

Learned how design optimization involves trade-offs between Cl and Cd for efficiency (i.e., maximizing Cl/Cd ratio).

üíª CFD & Simulation Techniques
Gained hands-on experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) through tools like OpenVSP and VSPAero, using them to simulate airflow over wing geometries and extract key aerodynamic parameters.

Learned how simulation accuracy depends on:

Geometry fidelity

Mesh density and refinement

Solver settings and convergence criteria

Understood the computational cost of CFD methods, including time-intensive meshing and iterative solver cycles, especially when analyzing large numbers of configurations for optimization.

ü§ñ Machine Learning Integration
Created a large dataset of wing geometries and their corresponding aerodynamic coefficients using automated simulations.

Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models (MLP, CNN, DNN, SVR, Random Forest, PINN) to predict Cl, Cd, and Cm from geometric parameters.

Learned how ML can serve as a surrogate model for CFD, drastically reducing evaluation time and enabling rapid design iteration without sacrificing much accuracy.

üîç Key Technical Takeaways
Developed skills in feature extraction, data preprocessing, and model evaluation using metrics like R¬≤ and RMSE.

Gained exposure to physics-informed learning through PINNs, blending data-driven models with domain knowledge.

Improved ability to interpret and validate simulation and model outputs in the context of physical feasibility and aerodynamic theory.

üìë Scientific Communication
Writing a formal research paper helped refine my academic writing skills, organize experimental findings, and present comparative model analysis in a clear, data-backed format.

Problems faced 
As a mechanical engineer it was hard to do the machine learning part but with advancement in ai just writing prompt in the chatgpt provided me with the code i need and i could modify it whoever i want this makes it easy for me with this project
